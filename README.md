Hi Everyone,

My name is Sean Kim and this is my portfolio, to practice my data analysis and machine learning skills that I will be gaining over the MOOCs and other courses taken. I would like to be a data scientist and my goal about this portfolio is to display every single machine learning and statistical technique in a detailed manner so that it is reader-friendly. So hang-on and lets go on a journey of data science with me!
